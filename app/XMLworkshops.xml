		<workshopName>8th International Workshop on Data Management for Sensor Networks (DMSN 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>The workshop's scope includes all important aspects of sensor data management, including data acquisition, processing, and storage in remote wireless networks; the handling of uncertain sensor data; and the management of heterogeneous and sometimes sensitive sensor data in databases. The resource-constrained, lossy, noisy, distributed, and remote nature of wireless sensor networks implies that traditional database techniques often cannot be applied without significant retooling. Challenges associated with acquiring, processing, and archiving large-scale, heterogeneous sets of live sensor data also call for novel data management techniques. The inherently incomplete and noisy nature of sensor data further calls for techniques for data cleaning, inference, approximation. Finally, in many applications, the collecting of sensor data raises important privacy and security concerns that require new protection and anonymization techniques.</workshopDescription>

		<workshopName>13th International Symposium on Database Programming Languages (DBPL 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>For over 20 years, DBPL has established itself as the principal venue for publishing and discussing new ideas at the intersection of databases and programming languages. Many key contributions in query languages for object-oriented data, persistent databases, nested relational data, semistructured data, as well as fundamental ideas in types for query languages were first announced at DBPL. Today, the emergence of new data management applications such as Semantic Web and Web services, XML processing, Social and Sensor Networks, Cloud Computing and Peer-to-peer data management has lead to a new flurry of creative research in this area. DBPL is an established destination for such new ideas.</workshopDescription>

		<workshopName>3rd TPC Technology Conference on Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking (TPCTC 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>Over the past two decades, the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) has had a significant impact on the computing industry’s use of industry-standard benchmarks. For example, vendors and endusers rely on TPC benchmarks to provide real-world data that is backed by a stringent and independent review process. Vendors also use TPC benchmarks to demonstrate performance competitiveness for their existing products, and to improve/monitor the performance of products-under-development. Many buyers often use TPC benchmark results as points of comparison when purchasing new computing systems. The technology landscape is continually evolving and challenging industry experts and researchers to develop innovative techniques to evaluate and benchmark computing systems. The TPC remains committed to developing highly relevant benchmark standards and will continue to develop new benchmarks to keep pace. With this conference, the TPC encourages researchers and industry experts to submit novel ideas and methodologies in performance evaluation, measurement, and characterization.</workshopDescription>

		<workshopName>8th Workshop on Secure Data Management (SDM 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>Although cryptography and security techniques have been around for quite some time, emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence that exploit increasingly interconnected networks, mobility and personalization, put new requirements on security with respect to data management. As data is accessible anytime anywhere, according to these new concepts, it becomes much easier to get unauthorized data access. Furthermore, it becomes simpler to collect, store, and search personal information and endanger people's privacy. Therefore, research in the area of secure data management is of growing importance, attracting attention of both the data management and security research communities. The interesting problems range from traditional ones such as, access control (with all variations, like dynamic, context-aware, role-based), database security (e.g. efficient database encryption schemes, search over encrypted data, etc.), privacy preserving data mining to controlled sharing of data. The aim of the workshop is to bring together people from the security research community and data management research community in order to exchange ideas on the secure management of data. The workshop will provide forum for discussing practical experiences and theoretical research efforts that can help in solving the critical problems in secure data management.</workshopDescription>

		<workshopName>9th International Workshop on Quality in Databases (QDB 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>The problem of poor data quality in databases, data warehousing and information systems largely and indistinctly affects every application domain. Many data processing tasks (such as information integration, data sharing, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery from databases) require various forms of data preparation and consolidation with complex data processing techniques, because the data input to the algorithms is assumed to conform to nice data distributions, containing no missing, inconsistent or incorrect values. This leaves a large gap between the available "dirty" data and the available machinery to process the data for the application purposes. Building on the established tradition of seven previous international workshops on the topic of Data and Information Quality, namely IQIS 2004-2006, CleanDB 2006 and QDB 2007-2010, the Quality in Databases (QDB) workshop is a qualified forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas and solutions related to the problems of assessing, monitoring, improving, and maintaining the quality of data.</workshopDescription>

		<workshopDescription>The problem of poor data quality in databases, data warehousing and information systems largely and indistinctly affects every application domain. Many data processing tasks (such as information integration, data sharing, information retrieval, and knowledge discovery from databases) require various forms of data preparation and consolidation with complex data processing techniques, because the data input to the algorithms is assumed to conform to nice data distributions, containing no missing, inconsistent or incorrect values. This leaves a large gap between the available "dirty" data and the available machinery to process the data for the application purposes. Building on the established tradition of seven previous international workshops on the topic of Data and Information Quality, namely IQIS 2004-2006, CleanDB 2006 and QDB 2007-2010, the Quality in Databases (QDB) workshop is a qualified forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas and solutions related to the problems of assessing, monitoring, improving, and maintaining the quality of data.</workshopDescription>

		<workshopName>5th International Workshop on Ranking in Databases (DBRank 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>The workshop focuses on the semantics, the modeling and the implementation of ranking and ordering in database systems and applications. In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in developing effective techniques for ad-hoc search and retrieval in relational XML databases, text and multimedia databases, scientific information systems, biological databases, and so on. In particular, a large number of emerging applications require exploratory querying on such general-purpose or domain-specific databases; examples include users wishing to search bibliographic databases or catalogs of products such as homes, cars, cameras, restaurants, photographs, etc. To address the limitations of the traditional Boolean retrieval model in these emerging ad-hoc search and retrieval applications, Top-k queries and ranking query results are gaining increasing importance. In fact, in many of these applications, ranking is an integral part of the semantics, e.g., keyword search, similarity search in multimedia as well as document databases. The increasing importance of ranking is directly derived from the explosion in the volume of data handled by current applications. The user would be overwhelmed by too many unranked results. Furthermore, the sheer amount of data makes it almost impossible to process queries in the traditional compute-then-sort approach. Hence, ranking comes as a great tool for soliciting user preferences and data exploration. Ranking imposes several challenges for almost all data-centric systems.</workshopDescription>

In this workshop we want to explore the various aspects of uncertainty in data as well as techniques how to handle them in the domain of databases. In particular, we are interested in circleussing the different kinds of uncertainty, different models for uncertainty representation in databases, techniques for querying and updating data involving uncertainty, and the varying application areas in which handling uncertain data is involved.</workshopDescriptionMerged>

		<workshopDescriptionMerged>The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum to share original ideas as well as research results and practical development experiences among researchers and application developers. In this workshop we want to explore the various aspects of uncertainty in data as well as techniques how to handle them in the domain of databases. In particular, we are interested in circleussing the different kinds of uncertainty, different models for uncertainty representation in databases, techniques for querying and updating data involving uncertainty, and the varying application areas in which handling uncertain data is involved.</workshopDescriptionMerged>

		<workshopName>5th International Workshop on Ranking in Databases (DBRank 2011)</workshopName>
		<workshopDescription>The workshop focuses on the semantics, the modeling and the implementation of ranking and ordering in database systems and applications. In recent years, there has been a great deal of interest in developing effective techniques for ad-hoc search and retrieval in relational XML databases, text and multimedia databases, scientific information systems, biological databases, and so on. In particular, a large number of emerging applications require exploratory querying on such general-purpose or domain-specific databases; examples include users wishing to search bibliographic databases or catalogs of products such as homes, cars, cameras, restaurants, photographs, etc. To address the limitations of the traditional Boolean retrieval model in these emerging ad-hoc search and retrieval applications, Top-k queries and ranking query results are gaining increasing importance. In fact, in many of these applications, ranking is an integral part of the semantics, e.g., keyword search, similarity search in multimedia as well as document databases. The increasing importance of ranking is directly derived from the explosion in the volume of data handled by current applications. The user would be overwhelmed by too many unranked results. Furthermore, the sheer amount of data makes it almost impossible to process queries in the traditional compute-then-sort approach. Hence, ranking comes as a great tool for soliciting user preferences and data exploration. Ranking imposes several challenges for almost all data-centric systems.</workshopDescription>
